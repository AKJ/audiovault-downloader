# AudioVault Downloader

## Introduction

The [Audio Vault](https://audiovault.net/) is a community-supported project that aims to provide free access to audio described movies and television shows for use by the blind and visually impaired. It is easily the largest resource of it's type. As of this writing (December 2021) there are currently over 8200 movies and 5100 shows spanning every conceivable category.

## Disclaimer

I have no affiliation with the Vault. I simply have a deep passion for ensuring equal access to entertainment.

While many people and jurisdictions may view the efforts of the community as copyright infringement on the grounds of free distribution, we do not in any way promote this behavior. I would happily pay to watch audio described movies were they readily available. Unfortunately, some of the content here is either impossible to purchase, difficult to find or entirely unavailable elsewhere.

To these ends, no video is hosted on the site. Only audio files (mp3) are available for download.
